# Journal-week-2
Well, here you have it! My own journal of all the things I've done, from September 28 to October 2. The parts on this lecture are divided by this:

 1° The lectures and things I did on that day. Here, we get the "introduction" of what I did, followed by the talks of that day.

 2° The readings of the week.

 3° The videos of the week.

I hope you understand everything, and if you have any questions, just ask me! So, here we go!
## September 28

Today I learned about Todoist, an app in my browser that helps me keep more organized in all of my chores and tasks. I also got the opportunity to advance in an assignment of my audio processing class, where I learned how to make a UGen of an Amplifier.

### Getting to know the Hub (Kimberly Lantis)

You have to understand what the Hub is, why you need it, how to create profiles, and more!
What is a Hub? It’s a center of activity, a focal point, if you may. In nearsoft, it’s a reliable repository of nearsoft’s internal content.
Why do I need a Hub? I believe the answer for this is so you can look for information, and have confidence that what you’re looking for is true.

## September 29

Today I got to meet my mentor, face to face.He spoke about what these meetings are, similar to the Daily Standups (what did I do, what am I going to do, blockers). He explained to me what Front End and Back End are, that  they use HTML, JavaScript and CSS. We also had a small talk about the subjects of the Lightning Talks, he advised me to check about Software Development Models.

Finally, I filled my timesheets! I hope I did it right, because I filled the ones from last week and this week.

### Opportunity Seagulls (Fausto Guerrero)

In a short manner of speaking, this talk will be about finding the way to “the bread”.  Sometimes, a small opened door can bring a series of steps to an even major opportunity. Always try to have a window open for these kinds of opportunities, even when at the beginning it may not look like a bright future. Of course, don’t try and develop ALL of the ideas, but keep an open mind.

### Training

It’s the options that Nearsoft have. Courses, capacitations, training (of course), even books!  You can actually ask for a certification, and if the team that views the requests see it as a good idea for your growth, then you’re up for it!





## September 30

Some problems with the power of my house...ugh….Well, Right now I’m doing the presentation for my Lightning Talk, let’s see how it goes! I’m planning to do an intro of the subject, and then making a stand of why Data Science is a very important subject for any company! Also, the reunions I had, LTs and Wellbeing and the art of feedback.  I had the opportunity to finish the Scientific Method lecture, it has many different tools that I could use in the future for my investigations and work!


### LTs & Wellbeing (Mónica López)

The Organization (Leadership Team) and Wellbeing. Well, what do we work with? Software product companies, in long-term relationships. She talks about the organizational structure. Well, in Encora you look at everyone as equals, everyones is on your side, not above or below you. We may be in a change between horizontal (flat) structure and a structure where you don't have superiors, but there ARE people who take some heavy decisions around the company.  

Not saying that something is good or bad, all of these models have good and not-so-good parts. Actually, most of the models that we know are a hierarchy (your family, for instance). Another example is school. You go into class and there is someone in front of you. 

In these kinds of structures, you have the possibility of having a person that is going to help you or solve your problem. It’s good, I know, but you’ll find some limitations within it. The “boat” you are in is already shaped, and it’s going to get difficult for you to try and change a process inside the great-company-boat.  

I do believe that both structures (vertical and horizontal) have their own advantages and disadvantages. It may be hard for me at first to fit in the horizontal structure, because most of my life I’ve been living with the vertical one. As I said before, in your family, the school, church and most works, have this structure. And again, I’m not saying that it’s wrong to use this strategy, it’s just that when I get in a team with the flat structure, I’ll find something else, something new. Right now, I can only think of the word “Freedom”, because I would be able to be self-organized, I’d feel more empowered with the decisions I make, and I believe that the team in general would be more happy, more close to each other. Of course, it doesn’t mean that everything you think and say will get done, but you get the confidence that your idea will be heard, and get some sort of answer, and not just the message of “This only concerns your superiors”.


With this, comes leadership, a different kind. The idea of this is that:

1. Take ownership of a subject.

2. Invite the community.

3. Use organization and consultation.

4. Recognize the team’s dynamic.

5. Use the advice process tool.

6. Get things done.

7. Share results and/or operation.


Now, for the wellbeing. You need 4 things:
#### Nutrition.
Create a healthy lifestyle with a monthly planned schedule for your meals! This tries to balance between your physical activity and the food that you replenish your body with.

#### Mental health.
It’s necessary to learn different tools to face changes, getting better communication, handling your stress and anxiety. The objective of this is for the nearsoftians to find a better motivation and attention to the emotional problems.

#### Physical health.
Try and get an activity that distracts you. Get it in between your work, so you can distress and improve both your mental and physical health. Look at it as a “charge your battery” implementation. 

#### Financial health.
You need to construct a solid and secure financial future. Get the basic concepts of finance, tips for savings, investment, and other subjects.


### The art of Feedback (Anabel Montiel)

The feedback is essential, you have to start doing the “culture” of constant feedback. This culture has 2 steps: 
Understanding why feedback is very important to sustain our culture at Encora.
Getting some ideas on how to give and receive feedback in a way that helps everyone.

First, I have to know what “grow” means. As we all know, Encora is a flat structure, so the question immediately pops out of the head...how do you grow in an environment like this? It’s an internal growth. You look for:
* Multi-directional growth. 
* Keep a balance between the individual and collective growth.
* The goal: have more impact.
* You start being self-managed. 
* You start to help others.

You have to remember the phrase “I’m at my best when you are at your best” for this kind of growth. This can be interpreted as every responsibility is co-responsibility from everyone at the company, and here’s where the feedback enters. The feedback is as it follows:
For every action, there is a perception and adjustment, which provokes a reaction. That reaction gives a new perception. It may seem like an endless loop, but it’s not! Think of it as a spiral, in which for every loop you make, you start growing more.

At Encora, we want feedback to be a tool for critical thinking about ourselves and others, so we can make intelligent decisions about our future and help others grow with us.
If you make a correct feedback on the “good”, you could get recognized, start developing a sense of pride, and start to find meaning and purpose. In the opposite case, where you give feedback about the “bad”, you can find a healthy self-critic, you can also eliminate biases by creating awareness. Lastly, you can establish challenges.

You have to master the practice of giving and receiving feedback, because it sometimes depends on emotional awareness and regulation. This last thing mentioned depends con the CONTENT and the INTENT of the feedback.

Recommendations for giving feedback:
* Don’t delay and make things worse. Do it often.
* Be empathetic.
* Be clear about feedback, expectations and consequences.
* Be comfortable with uncomfortable emotions.
* Don’t be nice, be helpful.
* Identify the difference between 1-on-1 or group feedback.
* Follow up on feedback and recognize progress.
* Make the person feel safe.

Recommendations for receiving feedback:
* Don’t wait until the bomb explodes. Ask for feedback regularly.
* Be receptive.
* Focus on content.
* Don’t make it personal.
* Be honest about your emotions.

“Learning about feedback is like exercise, you can learn about exercise but that won’t give you a fit body”







## October  1

Alright, first things first, I had a meeting with my mentor, and he gave me some feedback about my presentation for the Lightning Talk, let’s see how it goes tomorrow! Got it practiced, so let’s hope for the best. I also finished the notes of “Scientific method”. It’s a good lecture, but a little confusing at times, they have different “situations” of how to attack a problem, and give you tools to use. I think most of the tools of all these situations are similar in one way or another.

### OMs Class (Luisa Yanes, Maria Margarita Noriega, Martha Adriana Urrea, Norma Amaya, Mike Fonseca)

Office Manager, let’s see what they do! Vendors, the general public, everything that needs to be addressed face to face are some of the tasks that these people do. They have the maintenance of the building, contracting the services of plumbing, electrical issues, paint, etc. Basically they keep the building working at its 100% capacity.

They are the main face of the company, the ones who get the reception of calls, attention to vendors and attention to external people. They also organize different kinds of events. The coordination and logistics of different trips (with clients or maybe a congress), they’re the fellas who you want to turn to. This includes the flights, the hotels where the team is going to arrive.



## October  2

Starting the day, I had the daily meeting with my mentor, he gave me some concepts that I didn't know about! He talked about Unit Tests, why we have to get those tests right. They help you checking if your code has issues with some specific details, so it functions correctly. He also told me about the Automation test, that it checks if the program you made works by itself. It’s also called a Regression test, where you basically validate that what you already made keeps working. Lastly, we have the Manual test, for the QA engineer. Here, the person in charge of the tasks looks for errors for the developer, and gives complete feedback on how to get that error. With that information, the developer can work properly on fixing the issue
Another concept I got to know was “Mock”. This was a very interesting tool, because it makes assumptions about how your program would work IF they get some specific value in return.  One last advice my mentor gave me was about the code I write. It’s easy to write a code that a computer can read, the real challenge here is to write a code legible for humans! It’s not as hard as it sounds, you just have to make sure that your methods and variables ALWAYS get full names of what they do or what they mean.



 ### Agile (Karen García)

The agile methodology has the goal of making business agile, not making teams agile. It gives you the basic principles of how to work. Below the Agile method, we have the Kanban principles, in which you have to visualize the workflow, limit your Work In Progress (WIP), and measure the lead time. You have to make estimations about your work, so you don’t start giving misleading information about when you’re going to give the final product. Ask  all the questions that you have, so you can get the details of the project (those details tend to be very important in the distribution of your working time).

We also have the Scrum model under the Agile method, which has specific Roles (product, owner, scrum master, team), the Meetings (Sprint planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Demo, etc.) and Artifacts (Product Backing, Sprint Backing, Whiteboard, Metrics). The feedback in this model is very important, because it helps the team know where the project is currently, and if a specific part of it is stuck, so the whole team can see about the problem and fix it. As a team, you need to have management responsibilities that are divided among all the roles.

# All of the lectures

## How to talk to anyone

Well, it’s just as the title says! The summary of the lecture gives us plenty of different tools to use when coming to a conversation. I think that this lecture is directed to people who have difficulties to talk to people: in other words, introverted people should look for this lecture, even if it’s just the summary! 
I personally believe that while this was some good knowledge and techniques to use in your daily life, it’s almost impossible to remember all of the techniques while speaking to someone, and even worse, to try and use them in the conversation. Even if you study all of the lecture the night before talking to someone, there’s a high chance that you will not remember every lesson given to you, and an even higher chance that you will not execute them. The objective of the lecture is to try and make you a person who can effectively communicate with everyone, while looking like a normal human being. That is a very noble reason for the lecture to exist, but I actually think that it would give you the opposite results. Anyone who remembers all the steps of this lecture and EXECUTES them, will look like some kind of weird robot/human/something from the robocop movies. Yes, perhaps you will get some decent results on your communication, and even the first impression that you give to someone will be great, but it would just help you from the beginning.

Of course, I agreed with some of the things the lecture said (and not so much with others), but maybe a way to improve even more this lecture would be to give a “warning” at the beginning saying something like “These are the basics for the recipe you’re trying to make, make sure to give it a personal touch of yours!”. Well, that’s an analogy, huh? Stay with me so I can have a chance to explain. When I was reading the lecture, I started to remember a book that I read a while ago...about...how to get better with ladies (that’s a story for another day, but get in mind that I’m shy). 
Alright, this book got into a chapter where it was saying examples of cans of words. Depending on the situation you were in, you would use one of these cans to give a good comment, or a great combination of words that would make your listener excited with your feedback or with your response. Here’s the difference between this book and the lecture: the book kept telling me to not act like I had the answer for the questions written in front of me, because that makes you look unnatural. Maybe I’m exaggerating, maybe the lecture intrinsically was telling the same thing, but we have to remember who the audience this book is aimed for is. 
For introverted people, speaking in front of even 2 people gives them an anxiety attack, or they just freeze and get silent. For them, this lecture would be something like a “golden book” where they would start doing each and every single one of the steps, just to see that without their own “essence” to these steps, they would just be seen as robots throwing out questions.

Again, this is my point of view, but I think, as a shy person, that I can at least START to comprehend the difficulties that an introverted person would have on communicating with someone else, and the impotence of not being able to do it. After all, what is the biggest wall that a person can have around? The communication barrier. That’s the reason that these kinds of tools/lectures  need to be precise on every single step. But again, it’s just my opinion, maybe someone who needs it badly had better results with this formula!


## Ideas are just a multiplier of execution

This was a very short lecture, so I hope I didn’t miss a link or something. Well, the title pretty much sums it up. Actually, I need to give an explanation for this. You have 2 blocks in this, the idea block and the execution block. For the idea block, depending on how good your idea is, we give it a value! The better the idea, the higher the value (which is good). For the execution block is the same, the better you execute your idea, the higher the value we give to the execution. Of course, no execution means a value of zero (which is bad).

To check whether the 2 blocks are good enough combined, we need to multiply the values given. If we have an incredible idea, but the execution doesn’t exist, the value is worth zero. If you have an awful idea and no execution, you’ll also get a value of zero. But what happens if you get a brilliant idea with a brilliant execution? Your idea will be worth so much more! That’s what the lecture tries to pass to you, the fact that any idea, good or bad, is worth nothing, if it doesn’t leave your head.


## Missing semester: the linux shell

Now, a different kind of lecture than the other ones I had so far. This lecture tries to give the basic tools to have when getting into a computer problem. And it does so by talking about the shell. A shell is a “textual interface”, where you can modify most of the program you have by typing commands into the prompt that you have. Most of the computers have at least one system prompt, so everyone who wishes to use it can do it.

In the lecture, they start giving you some basic commands to use them in your prompt. I did use some of them, just to see how all of this works. It then starts to explain about the paths that your program can have, or even specific commands, and where you can find those commands. I think it’s a great basic tool to start to work on the programming environment, mostly because of its global usage. The lecture mentions that sometimes, the pages you search  and browse have limitations about buttons, actions, etc. Here’s where the shell comes to action. The textual interface allows the user to modify things and aspects of the program that it couldn’t do, mostly because the user couldn’t see these aspects. In a way, it’s something similar to what Python does, the difference being the language in which the code is processed. I don’t think I can write more about this lecture, because it keeps talking about the basic commands that it has. What I can conclude of it is that it’s a powerful tool for programming, so I’m putting my finger on this line, so I can continue to see the lessons given by the course.


## What are the most profound life lessons from Stanford Professor John Ousterhout?

Almost got tricked by clicking the Ad before the real lecture! Alright, First of all, I loved this lecture, it was so refreshing for me to read this, because I had a different way of looking at software development! Many of the advices that the lecture gives you I would have never guessed that it’s a common thing in the development environment. Let’s check each of the “life lessons”, shall we?

### 1° The greatest performance improvement of all is when a system goes from not-working to working

This may have been the lecture that impressed me the most. Normally, when I programmed something, I tried that my code was efficient, and that it could process my signals (or images, depending on the project) in a very quick way. Of course, you’ll not wait for a signal to be processed for 1 entire day, but I believe that a difference of seconds, even minutes, it’s not so bad after all. Again, there are examples where you need your code to work fast enough for the demand of the clients, but you have to apply the good ol’ “first things first”. Get your code working in the first place, and then start working on the details. As the lecture said, check for bottlenecks, it may surprise you to find these in the place you would have guessed last.

### 2° Use your intuition to ask questions, not to answer them

We all love when our favorite character in the One Piece anime uses “Haki” to predict movements or detect hidden enemies. If the person reading this is not a fan of OP, my apologies, I’ll explain it right now. What I mean with this last example is that most of the people secretly (or openly) love when an intuition is correct. I don’t know how to explain it, but perhaps it’s a feeling of “coolness” which we all like, and is perhaps one of the reasons this is one of the life lessons. An intuition is a great weapon/tool to have, BUT you have to sharpen it. How do you do that? Start to safely check where your intuition takes you. If it takes you close to the root of the problem or answer, then you’re on the right track! If you get nowhere near that root, maybe you have to analyze the details of the situation, so that next time, your intuition gets better. And remember, it’s a tool (or weapon, if you liked it that way), its purpose is to support you, don’t use it as a guide on taking concrete decisions.

### 3° The most important component of evolution is death

In contrast with the first life lesson, this is perhaps the one I disagree with the most, at least with the first part. For me, it implies that sooner or later, you’ll have to crash into the ground with your company. I strongly believe that if you keep updating your knowledge and yourself, you’ll have no problem adapting to the new world. It may be hard at first, because the world changes at an alarming rate, but you’ll start getting the correct rhythm of it. Ironically, this point of mine disagrees with the counter-example part. Maybe it’s not of making a complete change and starting from square one, but instead trying to improve the main applications of your software. Of course, I’m a rookie in this environment, so I think it’s normal for me to think the other way around.

### 4° Facts precede concepts

Another piece of life-lesson I liked a lot. You need strong facts to have a strong opinion/argument. In this case, the same applies to a strong concept, and perhaps it’s crucial for the concept to have strong facts. An opinion or an argument is something more subjective, while a concept needs to be more objective-based. Of course, you’ll need to get some examples to your explanation, otherwise your concept will not stand as strong as you may think. You may wonder why: the concept that you’re trying to explain, you already master the subject. You’ve practiced your presentation hundreds of times. But not your viewers. They will look at the concept for the very first time, and perhaps in a fast-forward way of presentation. An example can stick around in a better way than the concept itself! 

### 5° If you don’t know what the problem was, you haven’t fixed it

“How did you do that combo?!” “I pressed all the buttons at once!” That was one of my first thoughts while reading this life-lecture, and I think it’s spot on what it wants to transmit. You have to get the mentality of finding the problems and solving them, and not just hope for them to disappear. You could even try the third law of Newton (I hope I’m not mistaken about the number) “ for every action there’s a reaction”. In  other words, for every bug there's a line of code waiting to get cleared. Don’t expect that you were just unlucky to get an error and then the error disappeared: it happened because of a reason, so it’s up to you to see if you can recreate the error, or if you’ll wait to see if it’s the president of the company that will get the error (spoiler, you don’t want that).

### 6° If it hasn’t been used, it doesn’t work

Again, great lecture! Finishing your project is one thing, getting it tested PROPERLY is another thing. Why the emphasis on that word? Well, in a personal experience, something similar happened with my thesis project. I was so immersed in the project, working on the applications and checking for errors. Naturally, I knew exactly how I had to use the interface. The detail here was that my professors didn’t. My first meeting with them was a disaster (a positive disaster). It was a great talk with them, because they saw the problem from a different angle, so they made clear that my mistakes were easily solvable, I just needed a more open mind. That’s exactly the point of this lecture, to give your project to someone else so they can destroy it, so you pick the bigger, strong pieces of it, and you can end up with a beautiful project.




### 7° The three most powerful words for building credibility are “I don’t know”

As the lecture said, sometimes we see the lack of knowledge as a weakness, and even fear of thinking “what will everybody say about me after this”. We have to get on our minds 2 things. The first one is “nobody is perfect”. Of course it’s impossible for you to know everything at the moment, which is the second point “The more you know, the more you realize you don’t know”.  If you start acting more based on your honesty, people will quickly start to see that there are no deceive intentions in you, and so will know when you know and when you don’t know. 
In a personal opinion, I believe that you also have to know how to sound convincing when saying your arguments. Be careful here, because if you get good at this, you'll be tempted to start lying. After all, the messenger is very convincing right? The problem will come when you have to give some evidence about your “truth”.

### 8° Coherent systems are inherently unstable

You have to keep some variety in your system. It makes total sense when you start checking this lecture. I may have had a similar mentality about this, and the lecture gave me more confidence about the idea. As usual, I’m trying to not go to any extreme and say that both the coherent and incoherent systems have advantages and disadvantages. I believe that if you remain unpredictable, the harder it gets for “your enemies” to know where to hit you. If you have the same password for your social media accounts, and someone gets it, you’re going to have a bad time. In contrast, a different password for most of those accounts would have made the damage seem more acceptable. At least for the software development part, I believe it’s a great idea to have these kind of systems, so you are protected (hope I’m making some sense in here).


## Workflow

Sometimes, the way we work is just not good enough. There are critical flaws that make our work mediocre. At least, that’s how I think it is. In this lecture, the author mentions a “Freshout”, which is an efficient “formula” of work. Of course, as almost everything, this process got major updates on its techniques, ideas, and more, all so we can get better at our way of working. It says about a general process, which is a cycle we live in while we do things to understand the universe. I believe this part talks about our automatic pilot, the things we do everyday that make our own essence. But what would happen if we knew what steps to take? The same applies with the ideas at work, change that essence so you can improve!

Whenever you are working with a problem, you have to know what part of the problem you are. So, when you know this, you can start and think about a plan for the specific situation you are in. I think this is a good way to adapt yourself to different situations, because it teaches you to “expect the unexpected”. Of course, you will need specific tools and knowledge at each stage. You have to be aware that just because you have these 2 things, you’ll excel at your work, don’t be silly! Make sure you don’t skip something just because you don’t understand, instead, ask questions, read, so you can get better with practice and time.

Another tool the lecture talks about is about keeping a journal. What for? Well, the only way to return from a blizzard is to backstep (unless the snow covers your own steps, but that’s a different analogy). The journal is useful for keeping track of the process you’ve done so far, and so you can consult at that information any given time.

Now that we have these main tools, we can start with the Problem Discovery.  You try and get any information on anything related to the problem that they present to you. This process is so you can discover the components of the problem, what are its manifestations, and try to understand their causes and effects. The Observation is similar to the Problem Discovery. After gathering all of the data, you start to analyse it. You start proving if your ideas are right or wrong. And after that, you start with the generation of hypothesis. You start to think about what are the causes that make the effect of the problem. Remember, all knowledge is good knowledge,, so don’t be shy and write your hypothesis, based on the information that you currently have. Who knows, maybe the most crazy hypothesis ends up being true! Now we’re getting somewhere. You got your beautiful hypothesis, and now you have to test it with the Experimental Design and Tests. Remember, the better your experiment, the more efficient your results will be.

While doing this, we start to notice that 1 problem becomes more problems. Not to worry, you’re well prepared for this. We just need to have a simple definition for every problem we have. It cannot be complex, because we will start to lose the way of solving the issue. An advice for this part, it’s normal that you understand about the problem, but make sure that other people understand it too. Also, define the limitations that your problem and thus, your solution may have.

Now that we have all of this, the next part is to research for solutions! Don’t feel discouraged if you investigate your problem and you find that there are at least 5 answers to it….and you’ve got none of them. It’s normal, other people have more wisdom and experience than you. It’s always a good idea to check, you may end up learning a few things, and save yourself the steps of doing ideas that may have already failed.

Remember, your own solutions must be repeatable. You can do that by showing your methodology followed to explore a solution to a problem, the results, and the conclusions that can be drawn upon the results. 

Now that you have a lot of information on the problem that you decided to solve, it’s time to talk about some solutions. Think about many possibilities, and don’t worry: there will be a chance to discard ideas that won’t work later on. Now, for the modeling...remember about the limitations and ideas that might not work? Well, here you will discard those weird ideas that may not work, and choose the best one that fits into the constraints. After the model, we need a prototype, because it will tell us if our solution can be built, and if it will work for the final solution.

All of these techniques have been tested and repeated lots of times. I personally believe that while they may be good tools for the way of work, it can’t be the only answer to working efficiently. There are millions and millions of humans in the world, and millions and millions DIFFERENT minds in the world. Yes, the methods were tested, and yes, the results were promising, but it doesn’t mean that it has to be the only way. You can find your own rhythm and way of work, one where it can suit you better. Of course, if one of these techniques that I talked about seems attractive to you, go nuts!! As I said before, all knowledge is good knowledge, and if one of these tools helps you extract more knowledge, then you have found a great weapon against ignorance.


## Creative thinking hacks

Wow….what can I say about this video! I personally liked it a lot, the way of speaking and giving examples from Scott Berkun were spot on. Also, I learned that Michelangelo was jealous of Davinci, so he painted the sistine chapel (imagine having the power to convert your hate into something so beautiful...the world would be very different). 

The purpose of the talk is for some useful tips to get your ideas properly out of your head. It’s similar to the lecture of “Scientific Method”, in a more resumed way. We have 5 main steps for accomplishing this, and the first one is: 

### 1° Combination
This step begins with the phrase “ideas come from ideas”. In other words, you have to build on prior ideas to get the current one working. It’s a powerful message to those who want to invent things or make things happen. The past ideas are a great example of knowing what to do and what not to do. It’s similar to history, those who forget about history are condemned to repeat it. The same goes for ideas. You may think that a concept is great for your original idea, but when you get a more tangible feeling of this idea, you start realizing that it may be better to just scratch it from your list. It may be hard (or at least it feels like that for me) to not be able to do something 100% original, but it doesn’t mean that your idea will not innovate a working filed. 
Returning to doing something entirely from scratch, this concept is the same, it’s just that instead of ideas, you’ll be getting inspiration from the bases of the subject.

### 2° Inhibition
Sometimes, when we have an idea in our head, it gets eclipsed by the thoughts of “what would happen if I say this” or “what will they think of me”. This is such a difficult error to erase from your attitude, because of the feedback they may give us. You have to lose that fear, so you can start getting an advantage to everyone else. When you stop getting unexpected assumptions on your mind, your answer inside your head starts getting clear! The what ifs are a thing of the past, at least with giving some ideas or expressions it will say that you’re listening and following the whole subject, and not just nodding your head accordingly to the question.

### 3° Environment
In short, this step is so you can identify WHERE you work better, and WHAT you do to work better. Sometimes, the answer to your coding problem just won’t come to your head, you get stressed by thinking about it, you feel bad for stressing yourself, and then you stress yourself for feeling bad. Maybe your way of thinking could improve if you just took a deep breath outside of the office, or maybe by walking or jumping helps your mind get better ideas. What you feel comfortable doing, keep doing it, so the flow of the ideas get better. Keep in mind for those things that you do and those places that get the better of you, so that next time you’re geting a block, you can solve the issue quickly.


### 4° Persistency
A great word that I love and I’m familiar with. Always keep trying on your projects, never throw the towel. The path may sometimes be harder, and you may want to quit, but when you feel like that, just look behind, and check all the distance that you’ve travelled until you stopped. Also, remember all the new experiences and knowledge that you gained in your travel. If all good ideas were made at the first try...perhaps we would live in a more technologic world. Of course, that's the theoric part, the practice part comes with mistakes and trying again until you get the correct experiment done. Do not give up, check for the feedback that anyone could give you, so you start building on that.

### 5° Hacks
This step has some extra steps along the way, so you can check which of those you already have and which of those you could learn. The first one would be the **Journal** : as I said at the beginning of this writing, it has some similar aspects to the Scientific Method lecture. Always try to write down ALL of what you do in your investigation or experiments. It helps you look at possible mistakes in the future. Sometimes, you just have your head going at 100% of its capacity, so you need something to write so you don’t forget about all of those ideas. Remember, the difference between goofing around and science is writing things down! 
Now, for the **Escape**: here, your mind has 3 steps on processing an idea. The first step is understanding the idea. What is it for? How are you going to make it possible? Can you think of an improvement? Then, we get the  incubation  part, where the subconscious part of your head starts working on the idea. This is a “reflex”, you can’t really control, so you’ll need to trust your head on this one, so that when you think of the idea, you start getting the precise solutions. Lastly, we have the elaboration process. In here, you now have a good idea on how to execute it, so it’s time to bring the idea to life.
Going through the hacks, we have the **Invert**: Sometimes, when going through a storm of ideas, you try to give an idea to solve the original problem. But sometimes it’s so unclear of what’s the problem or how can you fix it. Worry not, because with this invert hack, you just simply need to think of the worst possible solution to the problem, so you start discarding ideas, and getting the road clear.
Now, for the **Partner** part: As you may have heard, 2 heads think better than 1. This is the exact concept for this hack. When you argue with someone, you listen to the point of view that the person has, a view that perhaps you could not see because of your own ideas. When you have these kinds of conversations, you can only improve your idea.
After this, we follow with a **Fail**. Excuse me? I want to get better at thinking and you tell me to think of failing? Well, not exactly. Of course, no one likes to fail, but it’s an important part of your growth. You have to be sure that you’ll fail at least once in your project, because that will make you know that you’re on the right path, a path where you know you’re doing something difficult or creative, and you know it’s worth it.
Last but not least, we have the **Switch**. No, not Nintendo Switch, I mean about switching your ways of communication. Maybe it’s not that you have to look through your code at least 100 times so you understand what’s wrong with it, but rather have someone who reads the code loudly, so you may find the problem with your code. You see? You would have gotten the problem by listening, not seeing. That’s all about switching.



## How progress really happens

Interesting video, the author gives us some examples about the progress being made in history, and what “blocks” you could possibly encounter on your way of changing something. First of all, we have to see what tools we currently have. Revolutions were made with some tools, Gandhi changed things in India with different kinds of tools, so….what do we need to make a good change? Clearly, it’s not the tools that you currently have, because there have been changes through history. Ready for the answer? Here it is...it’s the people who fight for that change (well, not exactly fight, but you get the idea). Yes, the people who want to make a change on something have to feel the motivation of doing the change. They have to be convinced that the changing of what they want will benefit everyone. This may be a problem because of many issues, and the first one would be the fear of putting your reputation at risk. That’s right, there cannot be a change until someone stakes their reputation on doing something different. When you have conviction, when you’re convinced of your own ideas because of what they mean, you can easily put your reputation on the line, because you know it’s worth it.
Another detail that you’ll encounter while changing is how much power you have. Sadly (but rightly) depending on the size of the change you want to make, you will need a proportional quantity of power. In other words, no power means no change.
One last block that you must take into consideration is that there may be people that don’t want change. From your point of view, it wouldn’t make sense, because the change you want to inspire into them is a good and noble labor. But what would happen if you see the things through their eyes? Exactly, you get fear. Normally, people don’t like change because of fear, and there are many reasons for it. The first one is because it creates a lot of work for the people wanting to change. Why would you modify your morning procedure for something you can’t even see? it's a comfort you don’t want to lose! Another reason for this is actually related to the last one, and it’s the requirement of thinking. Again, when you already have a schedule and way of working, and know that this schedule is useful, you wouldn’t want to change it. You’d need some time to adapt to the new procedures, and even have to learn how to use a specific tool.
Lastly, we have the talk and listen to others. A little selfish if you ask me, but people tend to want their opinions listened, and nothing else. Creating a dialogue and arguments for other people to see your point of view can be exhausting, even more if the other person is not making an effort to understand you.
As you can see, the conviction and motivation part were no joke. You need to surpass all of these obstacles to make a change, and remember, you’ll need to check on the size of your change, so you can be aware of the size of the power that you need.


## How to master anything

I believe that this video has something in common with another lecture of the week. Why? Because it gives you the lesson (and maybe warning) that if you want to achieve mastery of some sort of skill, it’s not enough to put 1000 hours into practice, you have to get the correct kind of practice. If you don’t have a good idea of how  a skill is supposed to look when executed correctly, you’ll start going around circles. Remember, these mental representations can give you a good amount of advantage, so you can start getting good at “deliberate practices”. Try and re-create experiences, so you can get the feeling of an action you’ve already done and need to do it again. Try and make some accurate predictions, that way, your intuition will get better. Also, instead of over-analyzing every move you make, try and condense it. Try to condense all of this information, so that when you put it into practice, you can get a cool, smooth move of your action. 
Remember, there may be some frustrations along the way, but it’s part of this next cycle:
Rapid progress of your skill.
Hitting a perceived limit.
Prolonged frustration.
Sudden Breakthrough.

Don’t feel bad for hitting a wall in your progress, or because a friend of your is learning much faster. It’s about you finding the right methods to keep learning and growing.


## Making Badass Developers

This was a very interesting video for me. I don’t think that it was aimed for developers, but for everyone who wants to know how good they are at learning things. The main objective of the talk is to check how fast you can learn, and about cognitive resources that you have.
This cognitive resource is the main material for this. It requires Expertise to have cognitive resource management. Returning to the learning pace, you get 3 steps to try and become an expert on something. The 3 parts are:

1. Can’t do (But need to).

2. Can do with effort.

3. Mastered (automatic).

We all start on point A, something that you really want to do but are not capable of doing, at least properly. Sometimes, the path for the mastery of a skill has some troubles. The most common ones are getting the tasks stuck on B, because you now know how to do the skill properly, but now they are expecting you to get fast enough. This can be a problem, if you don’t get the tasks thinner. Try and divide them, so you don’t get overwhelmed about all of the tasks that you have to do. 
Another problem is the tasks that you half do and stay on C. Alright, you are some kind of master on the skill...but you don’t do the job properly. For this problem, the solution can be to go back on the steps, check what you got wrong, check what you still need to learn, so you eventually end up finishing properly all of the tasks you were assigned.
Last but not least, the speed problem. Yes, you may be doing your tasks properly, but as I said at the beginning of this writing, the most important aspect is the velocity in which you’re learning.  For this, a solution would be skipping step B. Why?? Because it’s been shown that rookies tend to learn the cognitive activities (the most basic and important ones) in a better way than the professionals that need to learn everything on the skill they need. It may be ironic, but it makes sense when you think about it. Alright, you may not be an expert, but if you can do these 2 chores, you’ll be fine no matter what.
Of the 3 solutions, I think the last one is the most powerful one, and if used correctly, it could be used to make more professionals on the skills that are needed the most on projects. 


## Religion, evolution, and the ecstasy of self-transcendence

The video mostly speaks about us humans, and how we’ve been constructing our society as a whole. To talk about self-transcendence, we first need to talk about evolution, and to talk about that, we first need something to start. In this case, Jonathan Haidt gets the religion as an example, and explains about those moments where you get something like an epiphany . How is it that something that seems to occur so often in movies and even people that we closely know, doesn’t happen to me? Is it pure luck? Is it a “special feature” that I didn’t receive upon my arrival to this world? 
Here, we can start creating our way to the second part, the evolution part. Of course, the epiphanies are strange, but most of the time it’s not related to an evolutionary feature, rather just a part of our imagination. In evolution, you do need special features to keep surviving. Right here, right now, you are the result of millions and millions of ancestors that managed to reproduce themselves, making new generations. With each new generation, a new feature was learned, something that you could use to survive, and this knowledge was passed on generation to generation, until we got to you, the last link (so far). We get that there are strong and intelligent people around us, but there are far more “normal” people around us, so the question pops of the head...How did ALL of us survive? How are we here right now? That’s the last point of the talk, and a very interesting one.
Yes, we are individuals, surviving by our own methods. But sometimes, you don’t notice how the world is working around you, you get so concentrated in yourself (not in a narcissistic way) that you don’t see we work as a society, as a whole group looking for each other. Yes, there’s bad people (freeloaders, if you will) that will take advantage of that noble nature of most of the people. There are 2 ways for these kinds of people, either they will evolve into a more, selfless person who can help the society keep growing, or they will get eliminated. No, it’s not about killing the different ones, but they will have a difficult time trying to adapt themselves in a world that has no space for them. 


I think I got a little over the line with all this text...nevertheless, thank you so much for reading this! I hope you enjoyed my lecture!!. In case you have any questions, just let me know!
